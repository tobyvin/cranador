Chakra is a form of life energy with varying types that all individuals produce to some degree. This energy is often confused with ki, but the two are different in form and control. The energy circulates throughout the body in a network called the \"Chakra Pathway System\", which is similar to the cardiovascular system. Certain groups, such as shinobi, have learned to generate more chakra and release it outside their bodies through pressure points called Tenketsu in order to perform Jutsu. Kekkei Genkai are Jutsu that use multiple types of chakra at once, and are often connected to bloodlines. The maximum amount of chakra you have is dictated by your Shinobi level, as shown in the Chakra column of the Shinobi class table.</p>\r\n<p>The following rules apply to all Jutsu unless otherwise stated:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>To use Jutsu, you must be able to move both of your hands.</li>\r\n<li>All Jutsu take an action to use.</li>\r\n<li>All Jutsu require chakra.</li>\r\n<li>You have as much chakra as listed under the Chakra column + your Constitution modifier.</li>\r\n<li>You regain your chakra after you finish a long rest.</li>\r\n<li>Chakra and ki do not stack.</li>\r\n<li>If only dice are listed for a Jutsu&rsquo;s damage, you add your Dexterity modifier to the damage.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>At 2nd, 8th, and 15th level, you choose a chakra nature.

Jutsu cast outside of initiative cost half as much Chakra so long as the Jutsu is will not damage or otherwise negatively effect a creature directly.

Whenever you summon a creature, their size becomes Huge regardless of their original size. Their hit die also increase to a d12 instead of their original die size. A willing humanoid can be set as Summoning Creature.

You gain the service of up to 5 creatures of your choosing. Work with your DM to determine the origin of these creatures. The rules of Summoning follow the same as that of the Summoning Jutsu, with the exception of the following:</p>\r\n<p>You do not need to form any seals or sacrifice any blood to summon these creatures. Creatures summoned this way do not have a will of their own and follow your absolute command without question. They also cannot speak. Creatures summoned this way contain copies of your Rinnegan. This allows you to see throw their eyes as if they were your own. You can choose a new creature and swap it with one of your current summoning creatures as part of your long rest. Whenever you summon a creature, their size becomes Huge regardless of their original size. Their hit die also increase to a d12 instead of their original die size. A willing humanoid can be set as Summoning Creature. For this purpose, the humanoid is not under your control and does not follow any of the Summoning rules, but it still requires a chakra cost to summon. If summoned, the humanoid is simply transported to the location it was summoned to. The creature's individual CR cannot exceed that of CR 10, with the exception of the humanoid summoning.</p>\r\n<h5><span id=\"Naraka_Path\" class=\"mw-headline\"><big>Naraka Path</big></span></h5>\r\n<p>The Naraka Path grants the user two main abilities: interrogation and restoration, by using the King of Hell.</p>\r\n<p><br /><b>Jigokudo</b></p>\r\n<p><b>Cost:</b>&nbsp;25 Chakra</p>\r\n<p><b>Duration:</b>&nbsp;1 minute</p>\r\n<p><b>Range:</b>&nbsp;Touch or Self (10 feet radius)</p>\r\n<p>You summon a large disfigured head that sprouts from the ground amidst a vortex of purple flames known as the King of Hell and target all creatures you currently have grappled. The creatures must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become paralyzed. While the creature is paralyzed, you may question it at will. After the creature answers, the King of Hell unzips its mouth to release tendril-like arms and draws out an apparition of the creature's life force energy in the form of an enlarged tongue. If the creature lied during its interrogation, it must succeed on a DC 18 Deception check. On a failure, the King of Hell would remove the target's \"tongue\" and consume it, dealing 6d8 psychic damage to the creature and ending the effect on them. If the creature answered truthfully, the effect ends and the creature instead gains 1 level of exhaustion. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this technique dies instantly. A creature that does not share a language proficiency with you is immune to this effect.</p>\r\n<p>Alternatively when you cast this Jutsu, you can target a wounded creature within 10 feet of you. The King of Hell ingests the creature with its tendril-like arms. After 1 round, the creature regains 70 hit points and any conditions that were previously affecting it end. Any lost limbs are regained and the creature is otherwise returned to a perfect physical state. The creature then reemerges from the King of Hell's mouth.

These souls may be recalled from even the crossroad between life and the afterlife, and are then returned to their rejuvenated bodies. This counts as casting the True Resurrection spell without the 200 year limit.</p>\r\n<p>This technique can also be used to transform the corpse vessel of an individual revived by Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation into a real body of living flesh and blood.</p>\r\n<p>This technique has no limit to the amount of people you can resurrect, however once the technique is finished the user invariably dies and can only be brought back through the Wish spell or a similar technique.</p>\r\n<h5><span id=\"Rinne_Six_Paths\" class=\"mw-headline\">Rinne Six Paths</span></h5>\r\n<p>You learn to raise the dead through the Black Receivers.
