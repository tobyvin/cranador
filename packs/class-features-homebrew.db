Chakra is a form of life energy with varying types that all individuals produce to some degree. This energy is often confused with ki, but the two are different in form and control. The energy circulates throughout the body in a network called the \"Chakra Pathway System\", which is similar to the cardiovascular system. Certain groups, such as shinobi, have learned to generate more chakra and release it outside their bodies through pressure points called Tenketsu in order to perform Jutsu. Kekkei Genkai are Jutsu that use multiple types of chakra at once, and are often connected to bloodlines. The maximum amount of chakra you have is dictated by your Shinobi level, as shown in the Chakra column of the Shinobi class table.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0.4em; line-height: 1.5em; color: #2a1804; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12.7px; background-color: #fdf9d3;\">The following rules apply to all Jutsu unless otherwise stated:</p>\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 0.3em; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 1.6em; padding-left: 0px; line-height: 1.5em; list-style-type: square; list-style-image: url('w/skins/Sledged/bullet.gif?11907'); color: #2a1804; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12.7px; background-color: #fdf9d3;\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.1em;\">To use Jutsu, you must be able to move both of your hands.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.1em;\">All Jutsu take an action to use.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.1em;\">All Jutsu require chakra.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.1em;\">You have as much chakra as listed under the Chakra column + your Constitution modifier.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.1em;\">You regain your chakra after you finish a long rest.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.1em;\">Chakra and ki do not stack.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.1em;\">If only dice are listed for a Jutsu&rsquo;s damage, you add your Dexterity modifier to the damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0.4em; line-height: 1.5em; color: #2a1804; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12.7px; background-color: #fdf9d3;\">At 2nd, 8th, and 15th level, you choose a chakra nature.

You automatically gain affinity in one of the natures learned at 2nd level. You gain a Kekkei Genkai nature after getting both required Chakra Natures. Jutsu cast outside of initiative cost half as much Chakra so long as the Jutsu is will not damage or otherwise negatively effect a creature directly.

Chakra is a form of life energy with varying types that all individuals produce to some degree. This energy is often confused with ki, but the two are different in form and control. The energy circulates throughout the body in a network called the \"Chakra Pathway System\", which is similar to the cardiovascular system. Certain groups, such as shinobi, have learned to generate more chakra and release it outside their bodies through pressure points called Tenketsu in order to perform Jutsu. Kekkei Genkai are Jutsu that use multiple types of chakra at once, and are often connected to bloodlines. The maximum amount of chakra you have is dictated by your Shinobi level, as shown in the Chakra column of the Shinobi class table.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0.4em; line-height: 1.5em; color: #2a1804; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12.7px; background-color: #fdf9d3;\">The following rules apply to all Jutsu unless otherwise stated:</p>\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 0.3em; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 1.6em; padding-left: 0px; line-height: 1.5em; list-style-type: square; list-style-image: url('w/skins/Sledged/bullet.gif?11907'); color: #2a1804; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12.7px; background-color: #fdf9d3;\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.1em;\">To use Jutsu, you must be able to move both of your hands.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.1em;\">All Jutsu take an action to use.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.1em;\">All Jutsu require chakra.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.1em;\">You have as much chakra as listed under the Chakra column + your Constitution modifier.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.1em;\">You regain your chakra after you finish a long rest.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.1em;\">Chakra and ki do not stack.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.1em;\">If only dice are listed for a Jutsu&rsquo;s damage, you add your Dexterity modifier to the damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0.4em; line-height: 1.5em; color: #2a1804; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12.7px; background-color: #fdf9d3;\">At 2nd, 8th, and 15th level, you choose a chakra nature.

You automatically gain affinity in one of the natures learned at 2nd level. You gain a Kekkei Genkai nature after getting both required Chakra Natures. Jutsu cast outside of initiative cost half as much Chakra so long as the Jutsu is will not damage or otherwise negatively effect a creature directly.
