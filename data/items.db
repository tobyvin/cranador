Chakra is a form of life energy with varying types that all individuals produce to some degree. This energy is often confused with ki, but the two are different in form and control. The energy circulates throughout the body in a network called the \"Chakra Pathway System\", which is similar to the cardiovascular system. Certain groups, such as shinobi, have learned to generate more chakra and release it outside their bodies through pressure points called Tenketsu in order to perform Jutsu. Kekkei Genkai are Jutsu that use multiple types of chakra at once, and are often connected to bloodlines. The maximum amount of chakra you have is dictated by your Shinobi level, as shown in the Chakra column of the Shinobi class table.</p>\n<p>The following rules apply to all Jutsu unless otherwise stated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To use Jutsu, you must be able to move both of your hands.</li>\n<li>All Jutsu take an action to use.</li>\n<li>All Jutsu require chakra.</li>\n<li>You have as much chakra as listed under the Chakra column + your Constitution modifier.</li>\n<li>You regain your chakra after you finish a long rest.</li>\n<li>Chakra and ki do not stack.</li>\n<li>If only dice are listed for a Jutsu&rsquo;s damage, you add your Dexterity modifier to the damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At 2nd, 8th, and 15th level, you choose a chakra nature. You also gain access to the Basic Ninjutsu nature at 2nd level. You can forego learning a nature to gain affinity in one you already know, allowing you to add your unarmed damage to any damage rolls with its Jutsu. You automatically gain affinity in one of the natures learned at 2nd level. You gain a Kekkei Genkai nature after getting both required Chakra Natures. Jutsu cast outside of initiative cost half as much Chakra so long as the Jutsu is will not damage or otherwise negatively effect a creature directly. The purpose of Jutsu is to use them to the advantage of the party narratively, not just as a weapon, such as lighting a campfire with fire Jutsu, or putting out a burning building with water Jutsu.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your Jutsu save DC&nbsp;= 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your Proficiency bonus</li>\n<li>Your Jutsu spell attack bonus&nbsp;= your Intelligence modifier + your Proficiency bonus</li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"other","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Ninja 2","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"folder":"MrFCZu1fmP4pGnYt","sort":400001,"flags":{"mess":{"isBonusDamage":false}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

On a success, creatures take half damage.</p>\n<p>Chibaku Tensei can be dispelled by rendering the user unconscious or destroying the black sphere.

The rules of Summoning follow the same as that of the Summoning Jutsu, with the exception of the following:</p>\n<p>You do not need to form any seals or sacrifice any blood to summon these creatures. Creatures summoned this way do not have a will of their own and follow your absolute command without question. They also cannot speak. Creatures summoned this way contain copies of your Rinnegan. This allows you to see throw their eyes as if they were your own. You can choose a new creature and swap it with one of your current summoning creatures as part of your long rest. Whenever you summon a creature, their size becomes Huge regardless of their original size. Their hit die also increase to a d12 instead of their original die size. A willing humanoid can be set as Summoning Creature. For this purpose, the humanoid is not under your control and does not follow any of the Summoning rules, but it still requires a chakra cost to summon.

The creatures must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become paralyzed. While the creature is paralyzed, you may question it at will. After the creature answers, the King of Hell unzips its mouth to release tendril-like arms and draws out an apparition of the creature's life force energy in the form of an enlarged tongue. If the creature lied during its interrogation, it must succeed on a DC 18 Deception check. On a failure, the King of Hell would remove the target's \"tongue\" and consume it, dealing 6d8 psychic damage to the creature and ending the effect on them. If the creature answered truthfully, the effect ends and the creature instead gains 1 level of exhaustion. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this technique dies instantly. A creature that does not share a language proficiency with you is immune to this effect.</p>\n<p>Alternatively when you cast this Jutsu, you can target a wounded creature within 10 feet of you. The King of Hell ingests the creature with its tendril-like arms. After 1 round, the creature regains 70 hit points and any conditions that were previously affecting it end. Any lost limbs are regained and the creature is otherwise returned to a perfect physical state. The creature then reemerges from the King of Hell's mouth.

If you cast it using <a href=\"https://5e.tools/items.html#tinker's%20tools_phb\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'items.html', 'PHB', 'tinker\\'s%20tools_phb', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >tinker's tools</a>, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds.

The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p><p>The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don't study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you'll use to produce your effects. If you replace <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#cure%20wounds_phb\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'spells.html', 'PHB', 'cure%20wounds_phb', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >cure wounds</a> with <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#heat%20metal_phb\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'spells.html', 'PHB', 'heat%20metal_phb', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >heat metal</a>, you might be altering the device you use to heal—perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p><p>Such details don't limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell's effects. You don't have to justify how you're using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"33\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</span></span> <p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#blankhash,flstlevel:0=1,flstclass:artificer=1\"   >artificer spell list</a>.

To many, artificers seem like wonderworkers, accomplishing in hours what others need weeks to complete.</p><p>The description of each of the following infusions details the type of item that can receive it, along with whether the resulting magic item requires attunement.</p><p>Some infusions specify a minimum artificer level. You can't learn such an infusion until you are at least that level.</p><p>Unless an infusion's description says otherwise, you can't learn an infusion more than once.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"40\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Infusing an Item</span></span> <p>Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion's description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see \"Attunement\" in chapter 7 of the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG\"   >Dungeon Master's Guide</a>).</p><p>Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion for another one.</p><p>You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion immediately ends, and then the new infusion applies.</p><p>If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a bag of holding, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"41\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Artificer Specialist</span></span> <p>At 3rd level, you choose the type of specialist you are: Alchemist, Artillerist, or Battle Smith, each of which is detailed at the end of the class's description.

On a failure, the King of Hell would remove the target's \"tongue\" and consume it, dealing 6d8 psychic damage to the creature and ending the effect on them. If the creature answered truthfully, the effect ends and the creature instead gains 1 level of exhaustion. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this technique dies instantly. A creature that does not share a language proficiency with you is immune to this effect.</p>\n<p>Alternatively when you cast this Jutsu, you can target a wounded creature within 10 feet of you. The King of Hell ingests the creature with its tendril-like arms. After 1 round, the creature regains 70 hit points and any conditions that were previously affecting it end. Any lost limbs are regained and the creature is otherwise returned to a perfect physical state. The creature then reemerges from the King of Hell's mouth. This Jutsu has no effect on undead.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"units":"touch","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":1,"school":"evo","components":{"value":"","vocal":false,"somatic":true,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"folder":"12Gkf6MukHfiogW2","sort":1400001,"flags":{"mess":{"templateTexture":""}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}
