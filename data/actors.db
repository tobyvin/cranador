They attacked from out of the bushes like a tidal wave of bodies crashing into our cart, all the while gibbering in their foul, snarl of a tongue.&nbsp; We should have been prepared for them, I recall their weaponry was so poor one bugger was swinging half a broom handle with a small iron spike driven through; nonetheless, they overwhelmed us with their surprise attack and made off with a hefty share of the camp’s rations for the next month.<br><em>Captain Will Freidmont of the Upper Wilds Valdyrguard.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Goblins are evil creatures of diminutive stature who exist in almost every corner of the natural world as a constant yet generally manageable threat.&nbsp; Hailing from a group of creatures called goblinoids (which includes bugbears and hobgoblins), the goblin is a foul humanoid measuring no larger than the average halfling.&nbsp; Goblins have skin tones varying from light clay to deep chestnut brown to a sickly, acidic green, their hair is thin and greasy, and within their jaws rest cracked and sharpened teeth.&nbsp; Together with their foaming fellows, goblins form loose collectives or tribes so their power can stand pronounced in numbers.&nbsp; The tribal life also allows for a crude caste system to erupt from the goblin’s chaotic politics.&nbsp; All goblins have something to offer to the tribe, be they foragers, slavers, or warriors.&nbsp; If they cannot contribute, they die.</p>\n<p><strong>We Live in a Society.&nbsp;</strong> Capricious to the last, goblins crave nothing more than power and domination of all others around them by any means (including those methods dangerous to the goblin).&nbsp; Those goblins who possess enough might or cleverness may ascend to the rank of Goblin Boss and command a lair consisting of several dozens goblinoid fellows.&nbsp; Should ambition prove overwhelming, the boss in rare cases may subjugate nearby lairs of rival goblinoids and crown themselves a Goblin Queen/King.&nbsp; It has been documented that in one particular case, Queen Greld the Gutripper was able to enslave a camp containing hundreds of orcs, then laid siege to the city of Westerholt close by and sacked the entire city.</p>\n<p><strong>Gnash and Bite, Trick and Trap.</strong> Goblins maintain some of the most chaotic lairs within the known world, and to accomplish this the goblins require a plethora of slaves.&nbsp; Not always willing to murder those they plunder, goblins and their kin are known slavers, spiriting away captured humans from merchant wagons to contruct their insidious dungeons.&nbsp; WIthin a goblin lair is all manner of trap: tunnels leading nowhere, narrow passages no human could pass through, arrow slits, pits lined with spikes, and of course a multitude of alarms to warn the tribe of any impending danger.&nbsp; Goblins utilize chaotic placement within their lairs to throw off intruders from their hard earned loot which is kept safe within the lair’s heart.</p>\n<p><strong>And They Dance About the Flames.</strong> Goblins, though commonly thought of as greedy and stupid, leave their chaotic tendancies behind when it comes to the structure of religious worship.&nbsp; They are beholden in particular to The God of the Goblins, also called They Who Lurk Beneath, who acts as chief of all other gods to the goblinoids.&nbsp; This god encourages acts of violence, blind cruelty, enslaving others, as well as war amongst the enemies of the goblins.&nbsp; Goblin tribes will join together in times of worship to dance, perform rituals with blood and bone, build massive bonfires, and sew chaos throughout the lair all in devotion to their evil benefactor.&nbsp; Goblins, fueled by the spirit of the revelry, will then be exceedingly aggressive and volatile for the days after, raging through the surrounding area to sate the thirst of their cruel god.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

Cannon: Flamethrower","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>At 3rd level, you learn how to create a magical cannon. Using woodcarver&rsquo;s tools or smith&rsquo;s tools, you can take an action to magically create a Small or Tiny eldritch cannon in an unoccupied space on a horizontal surface within 5 feet of you. A Small eldritch cannon occupies its space, and a Tiny one can be held in one hand.</p>\r\n<p>Once you create a cannon, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. You can have only one cannon at a time and can&rsquo;t create one while your cannon is present.</p>\r\n<p>The cannon is a magical object. Regardless of size, the cannon has an AC of 18 and a number of hit points equal to five times your artificer level. It is immune to poison damage, psychic damage, and all conditions. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). If the mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 1 hour. You can dismiss it early as an action.</p>\r\n<p>When you create the cannon, you determine its appearance and whether it has legs. You also decide which type it is, choosing from the options on the Eldritch Cannons table. On each of your turns, you can take a bonus action to cause the cannon to activate if you are within 60 feet of it.

They attacked from out of the bushes like a tidal wave of bodies crashing into our cart, all the while gibbering in their foul, snarl of a tongue.&nbsp; We should have been prepared for them, I recall their weaponry was so poor one bugger was swinging half a broom handle with a small iron spike driven through; nonetheless, they overwhelmed us with their surprise attack and made off with a hefty share of the camp’s rations for the next month.<br><em>Captain Will Freidmont of the Upper Wilds Valdyrguard.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Goblins are evil creatures of diminutive stature who exist in almost every corner of the natural world as a constant yet generally manageable threat.&nbsp; Hailing from a group of creatures called goblinoids (which includes bugbears and hobgoblins), the goblin is a foul humanoid measuring no larger than the average halfling.&nbsp; Goblins have skin tones varying from light clay to deep chestnut brown to a sickly, acidic green, their hair is thin and greasy, and within their jaws rest cracked and sharpened teeth.&nbsp; Together with their foaming fellows, goblins form loose collectives or tribes so their power can stand pronounced in numbers.&nbsp; The tribal life also allows for a crude caste system to erupt from the goblin’s chaotic politics.&nbsp; All goblins have something to offer to the tribe, be they foragers, slavers, or warriors.&nbsp; If they cannot contribute, they die.</p>\n<p><strong>We Live in a Society.&nbsp;</strong> Capricious to the last, goblins crave nothing more than power and domination of all others around them by any means (including those methods dangerous to the goblin).&nbsp; Those goblins who possess enough might or cleverness may ascend to the rank of Goblin Boss and command a lair consisting of several dozens goblinoid fellows.&nbsp; Should ambition prove overwhelming, the boss in rare cases may subjugate nearby lairs of rival goblinoids and crown themselves a Goblin Queen/King.&nbsp; It has been documented that in one particular case, Queen Greld the Gutripper was able to enslave a camp containing hundreds of orcs, then laid siege to the city of Westerholt close by and sacked the entire city.</p>\n<p><strong>Gnash and Bite, Trick and Trap.</strong> Goblins maintain some of the most chaotic lairs within the known world, and to accomplish this the goblins require a plethora of slaves.&nbsp; Not always willing to murder those they plunder, goblins and their kin are known slavers, spiriting away captured humans from merchant wagons to contruct their insidious dungeons.&nbsp; WIthin a goblin lair is all manner of trap: tunnels leading nowhere, narrow passages no human could pass through, arrow slits, pits lined with spikes, and of course a multitude of alarms to warn the tribe of any impending danger.&nbsp; Goblins utilize chaotic placement within their lairs to throw off intruders from their hard earned loot which is kept safe within the lair’s heart.</p>\n<p><strong>And They Dance About the Flames.</strong> Goblins, though commonly thought of as greedy and stupid, leave their chaotic tendancies behind when it comes to the structure of religious worship.&nbsp; They are beholden in particular to The God of the Goblins, also called They Who Lurk Beneath, who acts as chief of all other gods to the goblinoids.&nbsp; This god encourages acts of violence, blind cruelty, enslaving others, as well as war amongst the enemies of the goblins.&nbsp; Goblin tribes will join together in times of worship to dance, perform rituals with blood and bone, build massive bonfires, and sew chaos throughout the lair all in devotion to their evil benefactor.&nbsp; Goblins, fueled by the spirit of the revelry, will then be exceedingly aggressive and volatile for the days after, raging through the surrounding area to sate the thirst of their cruel god.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

Colleges</h1>\n<h2>College of Lore</h2>\n<p>Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.</p>\n<p>The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.</p>\n<p>The college&rsquo;s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.</p>\n<h3>College of Lore Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.e9ytGikyLFgwZ5wi]{Bonus Proficiencies} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.5zPmHPQUne7RDfaU]{Cutting Words}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.myBu3zi5eYvQIcuy]{Additional Magical Secrets}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.pquwueEMweRhiWaq]{Peerless Skill}</p>","chat":"<p>An inspiring magician whose power echoes the music of creation</p>\r\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family: Roboto Condensed; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d8<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong>&nbsp;Charisma<br /><strong>Saves:</strong>&nbsp;Dexterity &amp; Charisma</p>","unidentified":false},"source":"(pg. 51) (pg. 54)","levels":11,"subclass":"College of Lore","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":"<i class=\"fas fa-edit\"></i>","spellcasting":"full"},"sort":300000,"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"dnd5e.Tidy5eItemSheet"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/affliction_24.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"0BhTvQgtadOzS0og","name":"Unarmed Strike","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons).

It has a normal range of 60 feet and no long range, and on a hit, it deals psychic damage equal to your current damage die for the shadow blade plus the ability modifier you used for the attack roll. The blade vanishes immediately after it hits or misses its target, and it leaves no mark on its target if it deals damage. These daggers are finesse weapons and are considered light weapons for 2 weapon fighting.These Weapons are also able to be converted to be magical weapons&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Rogue : Ethereal Shadow","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"sort":5200000,"flags":{"vtta":{"dndbeyond":{"requiredLevel":3,"displayOrder":1,"class":"Rogue : Ethereal Shadow"}}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"mohZRj5bQoPddtiC","name":"Sneak Attack","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe&rsquo;s distraction.

Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower rank.

You trained as a youth, studied the use of weapons and armor, learned basic survival techniques, including how to stay alive on the battlefield. You might have been part of a standing national army or a mercenary company, or perhaps a member of a local militia who rose to prominence during a recent war.</p><p>When you choose this background, work with your DM to determine which military organization you were a part of, how far through its ranks you progressed, and what kind of experiences you had during your military career. Was it a standing army, a town guard, or a village militia? Or it might have been a noble&rsquo;s or merchant&rsquo;s private army, or a mercenary company.</p><h3>Military Rank</h3><p>You have a military rank from your career as a soldier. Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower rank. You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition simple equipment or horses for temporary use. You can also usually gain access to friendly military encampments and fortresses where your rank is recognized.</p><h2>Backstory</h2><p>War. War never changes. But magic, magic changes.
